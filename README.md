# Prestige-Worldwide

This is the web site for Prestige Worldwide, a marketing/ advertising/ talent aquisition/ event planning company. The site offers a list of services, services details, and a contact us form.

JQuery was added to the Navigation Bar to make it disappear when scrolling. Jquery was also added so that a smooth scroll would occur after clicking hyperlinks.

In order for a user to utilize this site, they would only need internet access to download the copy of the project and a main stream browser. The project has been normalized to work on all w3 compliant browsers. Due to the project being hard coded with custom css, internet access is not required to utilize the web site after the initial download.
